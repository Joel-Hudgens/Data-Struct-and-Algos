# Data-Struct-and-Algos
A collection of projects that I have completed for data structures and algorithms class.
I learned so much by implementing these programs in C++. 

Each folder contains the code files as well as the executable for the program. If you are going to run this code, it is important to read the documentation I have written in the main file which is titled "Assignment#.cpp". This file will show you how the io system is structured so that you can properly command the program and read the results.
